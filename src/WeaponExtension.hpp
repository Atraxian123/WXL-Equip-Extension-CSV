        // Not model-load-related at all -- reused purely as the earliest possible, unconditional
        // trigger to kick the one-time weapon sidecar load off, exactly the same rationale as
        // CreatureExtension::OnModelLoadPre (see that class's doc comment for the full case).
        // OnModelLoadPre fires for ANY model init anywhere in the client, including the
        // login/char-select glue scene's own preview models -- pets, mounts, AND their held weapons
        // can all render there, well before the client ever enters the actual game world.
        //
        // This is WeaponExtension's ONLY job: kick off sidecar loading, which itself decides (via
        // WXLExtendedEquipment.ini's [EagerPreload] Weapons key) whether to also eagerly bake every
        // sidecar-known displayId's Model1/Model2 virtual .m2 bytes into the process-lifetime
        // override table ahead of time. Either way, VirtualPath.cpp's VirtualProvide falls back to a
        // lazy resolver (WeaponLazyResolve, registered once from this class's constructor) on any
        // displayId/column that wasn't already baked -- decoding the exact virtual name the loader
        // just missed on and baking it on the spot, before that miss is ever handed back.
        //
        // Unlike EquipExtension's older weapon path, this module never touches ItemDisplayInfo at
        // runtime and never hooks OnItemDisplayLookup: ItemModelData.dbc's Model1/Model2 fields are
        // patched at the data level (outside this module, same convention as CreatureModelData's
        // ModelName field for creatures) to already name the correct per-displayId virtual path
        // directly -- see WXLWeaponModels.csv/WXLWeaponTextures.csv's column comments in
        // WeaponExtension.cpp for the exact deterministic virtual-path shape to write there. The
        // native loader then always just asks for the right file on its own, eager or lazy, with no
        // race/gender variant handling (weapons here are never race/gender suffixed) and no
        // shared-row corruption risk between displayIds sharing one base model file.
        //
        // Bakes are registered evictable, in their own "Weapon" pool -- see VPathPopulateGlobal's
        // evictionPool parameter in VirtualPath.hpp. Budgeted independently from
        // CreatureExtension's pool via WXLExtendedEquipment.ini's [Memory] MaxWeaponCacheMB (default
        // 512 MB if unset; <= 0 means uncapped). A weapon evicted for being over budget isn't gone
        // for good: the next load of it simply misses and WeaponLazyResolve rebakes it on the spot.
