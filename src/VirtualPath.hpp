     * @brief Registers a texture/material-patched version of a model under a per-itemDisplayId
     *        VIRTUAL archive path (real path with "_<itemDisplayId>" inserted before the
     *        extension), so every future load of that virtual path -- from any character, any
     *        client, any owner -- is transparently served the patched bytes.
     *
     * Unlike VPathPopulate, this is NOT scoped to a cmo and NOT keyed by a mangled "_wxl_" name.
     * It IS still keyed by itemDisplayId, though: two different ItemDisplayInfo rows that happen
     * to point at the same underlying model file (e.g. shared weapon geometry with a
     * displayId-specific texture/material patch) each get their own distinct virtual path and
     * therefore their own table entry, rather than colliding on one shared key the way registering
     * under the bare real path would. The patch itself is still treated as a property of the
     * model file -- not of the wearer -- for a given displayId; it is not scoped to a cmo, e.g. a
     * weapon's base ModelTexture_1/2 (vanilla only auto-binds that natively for Head/Shoulder;
     * everywhere else, including weapons, something has to bake or bind it) and/or a weapon's
     * extra glow/emissive layers. There is no per-cmo eviction for these entries: once registered,
     * the override stays for the life of the process, and the first (texPath, materialPatchSpec)
     * pair registered for a given (path, itemDisplayId) wins for the rest of the session -- later
     * calls for the same pair with different arguments are no-ops (see g_globalOverrides).
     *
     * Because the served bytes now live under a virtual path rather than the model's own real
     * name, nothing will transparently intercept the native loader's request for the original
     * path any more -- the caller is responsible for getting that virtual path in front of the
     * loader instead (e.g. by pointing the resolved ItemDisplayInfo model field at it).
     * outVirtualPath, if non-null, receives that path so the caller can do so.
     *
     * No per-batch texture-slot override -- callers that need that should still go through
     * VPathPopulate on a per-attach basis. A geoset filter IS supported here (geoIds/geoCount),
     * unlike the original version of this function -- it behaves the same as VPathPopulate's own
     * geoIds/geoCount: submesh sections whose sectionId isn't in the list get their indices zeroed
     * out of the .skin bytes, geoCount == 0 means "no filter, keep every section". Like texPath and
     * materialPatchSpec, it's part of the (path, itemDisplayId) pair's first-registration-wins bake --
     * not re-appliable later with different ids for an already-registered pair.
     *
     * @param realMdxPath        real archive path of the .mdx (as ItemDisplayInfo/sidecar would give it)
     * @param itemDisplayId      ItemDisplayInfo display id this patch belongs to; mangled into the
     *                           virtual path so distinct displayIds sharing a model file don't
     *                           collide on the same table entry
     * @param texPath            full BLP path to bake into the model's replaceable/hardcoded texture
     *                           slots (OBJECT_SKIN records only, promoted to hardcoded, same as
     *                           VPathPopulate's PatchReplaceableTextureTypes step -- WEAPON_BLADE is
     *                           never touched by this and needs an explicit sidecar TextureType=3

     * @param geoCount           number of entries in geoIds
     * @param evictable          if true, this bake is registered as reclaimable: once the combined

     *                           [Memory] MaxCreatureCacheMB budget, the least-recently-served
     *                           evictable entries are erased from the table (freeing their memory)
     *                           to make room, on a first-come basis as new evictable bakes come in --
     *                           see EvictOverBudget in VirtualPath.cpp. An evicted entry is NOT gone
     *                           forever: the next VirtualProvide request for it simply misses and, if
     *                           a VPathLazyResolver is registered that still recognizes it, gets
     *                           rebaked on the spot. Passing evictable=true WITHOUT also having a
     *                           lazy resolver in place for whatever id space this call uses is a
     *                           trap: the entry can still be evicted, but nothing will ever bring it
     *                           back, so any caller doing this needs its own VPathRegisterLazyResolver
     *                           registration covering the same ids (e.g. CreatureExtension's
     *                           CreatureLazyResolve for its own creature displayIds). Default false --
     *                           matches every existing caller's prior behavior (permanent for the
     *                           life of the process) unchanged.
     * @param outVirtualPath     optional destination buffer that receives the virtual path the
     *                           patched bytes were registered under (e.g. "...\\model_12345.m2")

     *                           its own LRU group table, its own running byte total, and its own
     *                           budget read from WXLExtendedEquipment.ini's [Memory] section under

     *                           VirtualPath.cpp. Pools never evict each other: a burst of weapon
     *                           bakes filling the weapon pool cannot push a creature entry out, and
     *                           vice versa, so one busy feature's cache pressure can't starve
     *                           another's. Ignored entirely when evictable is false. Defaults to
     *                           "Creature" for source compatibility with every caller written

     *                           particular, are unchanged and keep reading MaxCreatureCacheMB
     *                           exactly as before); WeaponExtension.cpp passes "Weapon" explicitly.
